# Apus

**A social wall for conferences with additional features.**

The name is *Apus* based on Apus Apus, Latin for common swift. This is a bird species that is extremely adapted to a life in the air and can stay in the air for around ten months almost without interruption and can reach speeds of more than 200 km/h during flight maneuvers.
