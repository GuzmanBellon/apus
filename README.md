# Apus

[![All Tests](https://github.com/McPringle/apus/actions/workflows/all-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/McPringle/apus/actions/workflows/all-tests.yml)

**A social wall for conferences with additional features.**

The name *Apus* is based on Apus Apus, Latin for common swift. This is a bird species that is extremely adapted to a life in the air and can stay in the air for around ten months almost without interruption and can reach speeds of more than 200 km/h during flight maneuvers. This bird breeds in a wall, flies reliably for extremely long periods without crashing and is also extremely fast. Hopefully all of this also applies to Apus: fast execution, uninterrupted and reliable operation!

## Build

### Maven

*Apus* uses [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to build the project. Please use standard Maven commands to build what you need:

| Command          | What it does                                                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `./mvnw`         | compile and run the app                                           |
| `./mvnw clean`   | cleanup generated files and build artefacts                       |
| `./mvnw compile` | compile the code without running the tests                        |
| `./mvnw test`    | compile and run all tests                                         |
| `./mvnw package` | compile, test, and create a JAR file to run it with Java directly |
| `./mvnw verify`  | compile, test, package, and run analysis tools                    |

There is *no need* to run the `install` or `deploy` tasks. They will just run longer, produce unnecessary output, burn energy, and occupy your disk space. [Don't just blindly run mvn clean install...](https://www.andreaseisele.com/posts/mvn-clean-install/)

### Docker

*Apus* comes with a complete dockerized self-contained build. You don't need to have Maven or Java installed, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is enough. The Docker build file contains everything needed, just start a standard Docker build with the following command:

```shell
docker build -t apus .
```

This might run for a while and will produce a Docker image tagged `apus` on your local system.

## Running and debugging

### Running from the command line.

To run from the command line, run `./mvnw` and open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

### Running and debugging in Intellij IDEA

- Locate the `Application.java` class in the project view. It is in the `src` folder, under the main package's root.
- Right-click on the `Application` class
- Select "Debug 'Application.main()'" from the list

After the server has started, you can view the UI at http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
You can now also attach breakpoints in code for debugging purposes, by clicking next to a line number in any source file.

### Running and debugging in Eclipse

- Locate the `Application.java` class in the package explorer. It is in `src/main/java`, under the main package.
- Right-click on the file and select `Debug As` --> `Java Application`.

Do not worry if the debugger breaks at a `SilentExitException`. This is a Spring Boot feature and happens on every startup.

After the server has started, you can view it at http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
You can now also attach breakpoints in code for debugging purposes, by clicking next to a line number in any source file.

## Configuration

*Apus* can be started without any specific configuration. All configuration options have working default values. To modify these default values just specify environment variables with the following names:

| Variable          | Default         | Description                                             |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| DOAG_EVENT_ID     | 0               | The ID of the DOAG event to read the conference agenda. |
| MASTODON_INSTANCE | mastodon.social | The Mastodon instance used to read the posts from.      |
| MASTODON_HASHTAG  | java            | The hashtag for the mastodon wall.                      |
| TZ                | UTC             | The timezone used for date and time calculations.       |

The environment variables will override the default values.

## Communication

### Matrix Chat

There is a channel at Matrix for quick and easy communication. This is publicly accessible for everyone. For developers as well as users. The communication in this chat is to be regarded as short-lived and has no documentary character.

### GitHub Discussions

We use the corresponding GitHub function for discussions. The discussions held here are long-lived and divided into categories for the sake of clarity. One important category, for example, is that for questions and answers.
